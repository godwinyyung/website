abstract: In  phase 1  dose escalation studies, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)
  are defined as  adverse events of concern occurring during a predefined time
  window after first dosing of patients. Standard dose escalation designs, such
  as the continual reassessment method (CRM), only utilize this binary DLT
  information. Thus, late-onset DLTs are usually not accounted for when CRM
  guiding the dose escalation and finally defining the maximum tolerated dose
  (MTD) of the drug, which brings safety concerns for patients. Previously,
  several extensions of CRMs, such as the time-to-event CRM (TITE-CRM),
  fractional CRM (fCRM) and the data augmented CRM (DA-CRM), have been proposed
  to handle this issue without prolonging trial duration. However, among the
  model-based designs, none of the designs have explicitly controlled the risk
  of overdosing as in the escalation with overdose control (EWOC) design. Here
  we propose a novel dose escalation with overdose control design using a
  two-parameter logistic regression model for the probability of DLT depending
  on the dose and a piecewise exponential model for the time to DLT
  distribution, which we call rolling-CRM design. A comprehensive simulation
  study has been conducted to compare the performance of the rolling-CRM design
  with other dose escalation designs. Of note, the trial duration is
  significantly shorter compared to traditional CRM designs. The proposed design
  also retains overdose control characteristics, but might require a larger
  sample size compared to traditional CRM designs.
